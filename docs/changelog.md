# Changelog

## v1.0.1

**June 22, 2020**

- Fixed an error when computing the `for_each` values for Elastic File System mount targets.

## v1.0.0

**June 19, 2020.**

This is the initial release, so from a philosophical standpoint, there have not been any changes yet.

Despite this being marked as a 1.0 release, Provose is still alpha-quality software.
